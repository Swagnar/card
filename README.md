## About

This application serves as my *curriculum vitae*. I took heavy inspiration from above mentioned Kanye2049, which is a media player/visualizer made for [toasy digital](https://toastydigital.com/). I wanted to make something simillar, a very crude simulation of a operating system, where each directory would tell a different story from my life.

**OS_OS** has following features:

- boot into a `Windows 3.x`-esque operating system. 
- explore directories, files and archives
- look around in the terminal (kinda broken I know)
- settings! turn on or off the flickering animation, change color scheme to dark mode, and change the resolution
- client side Floyd–Steinberg dithering for images
